## Performance Challenge: Fetch the top 3 users with the most posts and, 
    for each of those users, the latest comment they made. This should be achieved with efficient querying.

SELECT 
    u.id AS userId,
    u.name AS userName,
    COUNT(p.id) AS postCount,
    c.id AS commentId,
    c.content AS latestCommentContent,
    c.createdAt AS latestCommentCreatedAt
FROM users u
JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.userId
LEFT JOIN comments c ON p.id = c.postId
WHERE c.createdAt = (
    SELECT MAX(c2.createdAt) 
    FROM comments c2 
    WHERE c2.postId = p.id
)
GROUP BY u.id, c.id
ORDER BY postCount DESC
LIMIT 3;


2. Query Optimization Task:

SELECT u.id AS userId, u.name, latest_comment.content, post_counts.postCount
FROM users u
JOIN (
    SELECT userId, COUNT(*) AS postCount
    FROM posts
    GROUP BY userId
) post_counts ON u.id = post_counts.userId
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT content
    FROM comments c
    WHERE c.userId = u.id
    ORDER BY c.createdAt DESC
    LIMIT 1
) latest_comment ON true
ORDER BY post_counts.postCount DESC
LIMIT 3;
